<h1>INSTALL GUIDELINES</H1>

<p>1) Just install the Ubuntu distro's nginx.  It is all you need for what we are doing. </p>

<p>2) Place the "default" file in this folder into nginx's sites-enabled directory.  I sets up a basic nginx server that reverse proxies for socket-attached node.js server processes.  This will come in real handy.</p>
