<h1>Project Status</h1>
<p>If you've setup this project as asked, then open a web browser on the machine where it resides and goto <a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>.  You should see a 3D space showing a smaller sphere inside a larger, wire-framed sphere.</p>  
<p>The larger sphere has 36 sections and 18 rings.  This provides the basis for plotting the orbits of satellites around the earth (the smaller, solid sphere inside the wire-frame).  This larger, wire-frame sphere is called the celestial sphere.</p>  
<p>We are working in the field of celestial mechanics, now.  A good tutorial to get yourself started can be found <a href="https://www.amsat.org/keplerian-elements-tutorial/">here</a>.</p>  
<p>We are going to try to understand the math we will be using by first understanding the geometry.  First, animate the earth so that it accurately spins one full rotation each 24 hours without otherwise moving inside the celestial sphere.  Next, using TLE (two line element) data provided on a Starlink satellite by space-tracker.org, or similar data provider, plot that satellite's orbit in space using the coordinates on the celestial sphere. Information about TLE data can be found <a href="https://www.celestrak.com/NORAD/documentation/tle-fmt.php">here</a>.</p> 
<p>Once the orbit is plotted (it will be some kind of elipse), accurately animate the travel of the satellite along its orbit again using the TLE data.  Now you have two animations running at once:  a spinning earth (must be accurate with respect to the celestial sphere) and an orbiting satellite, again plotted with reference to the celestial sphere.   Now, all you need to do is place a camera on the surface of the earth-sphere (using latitude and longitude coordinates) and render what it sees over a few hours time.  What is should show is what a computer camera would show if it were taken to those same coordinates on earth, and pointed up at the sky, for the same durattion of time, and had the ability to see Starlink Satellites in orbit from the ground.  </p>
<p>Once we have this proof of concept, we'll figure out how to adjust for different camera angles and fields of view.  Ultimately, we'll provide an augmented reality utility that turns your smartphone into  a Starlink satellite viewer.</p>
