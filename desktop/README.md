<h1>The Desktop AKA Developer's Playground </h1>
<h2>Blender</h2>

<p>Blender is used in a number of ways in this project, including: </p>
<ul>
  <li>For editing and integrating media formats from other sources (video, audio, svg)</li> 
  <li>For producing 3D scenes, objects, and animations</li>
  <li>As an addressable Python repository of data and functions</li> 
  <li>For exporting 3D scenes and assets to a format recognized by Three.js </li>
</ul>
<p>The two most important outputs we get from using Blender are:
   <ol>
     <li> a .gltf file accessible by the Three.js api running in the client's browser</li>
     <li> .js files (written by Python with refernce to a 3D scene) also to run in the client's browser</li>
   </ol>
   
Here is an example of the workflow:
