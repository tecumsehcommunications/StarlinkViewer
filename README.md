<h1> Chapter I:  The Challenge </h1>

<p> The idea is simple.  We build an app that makes it so anyone who wants can point a computer camera at the sky and see a superimposed time-lapse animation of Starlink satellites that have been and will be passing overhead...with precision. &nbsp Sound good? </p>

<p>For obvious reasons, this has to run in a web browser.  So the app we are building essentially will be a 3d interactive animation using the javascript webGL api.  The tool chain for this kind of work is as follows: </p>
<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>I believe this currently is the most powerful 3d publishing tool chain on the planet, and with it we are going to make a world-class application available world-wide for free.</p>

<p>So saddle up, nerds.  It's time to ride.</p>

<h1>Chapter 2: The Bootstrap </h1>

<p>Your skills may intersect with one part of the above toolchain or several. &nbsp If you want to work with the entire toolchain, here is what you do: </p>

<p>1) Get a current version of Ubuntu running (currently bundles Python 3.7) </p>

<p>2) Install Emacs, Hy, Nodejs, Nginx, and Cojure/ClojureScript</p>

<p>3) See the emacs, nodejs, and nginx directories of this project for configuration files and instructions</p>

<p>4) Compile blender as a python module (see the <a href="https://github.com/tecumsehcommunications/StarlinkViewer/tree/master/blender">blender</a> folder of this project for instructions)</p>

<p>5) Clone this project </p>

<p>6) Start hacking you magnificent bastard. </p>

<h1>Chapter 3: Onward </h1>

<p>The Starlink viewer is just a piece of a larger puzzle that needs to be assembled in order for the Starlink network to come online.  Tecumseh Communications was chartered to work on that whole puzzle and to facilitate across the spectrum of trades, disciplines, and skill-sets that will need to come together for all this to take place. </p>

<p>Our work product in those areas can be accessed via the other repositories we manage on this site.  Have a look here and see if you can use or contribute something. </p>
